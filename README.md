# **THE HAMOYE DATA SCIENCE INTERNSHIP PROGRAM (HDSC)**

---

The Hamoye Data Science Internship Program (HDSC) provides an effective and free-of-charge opportunity for university or college students, recent graduates, and career professionals to acquire essential skills for establishing a successful career as a Data Scientist.

This internship is divided into 5 stages, Stages A - E.

## **STAGE A - Introduction to Python for Machine Learning** 

This stage is divided into three (3) sections:

* **Python in Machine Learning**: This section introduced the basics of manipulating, pre-processing, cleaning, and wrangling data in Python and how to use it to solve data analysis and machine learning problems.
* **Data Types, Data Wrangling, and Data Visualization**: In this lesson, I learned about the different types of data available to me as a data professional, how to handle them, and the processes involved in data wrangling. 
* **GRADED QUIZ**: For this graded quiz, I worked on the ***FoodBalanceSheets_E_Africa_NOFLAG*** and used the dataset to answer various questions.

## **STAGE B - Machine Learning: Regression - Predicting Energy Efficiency of Buildings**

For the B Stage it was divided into six (6) lessons:

* **Simple Linear Regression**: In this lesson, I learned about simple linear regression and the different assumptions made by simple linear regression models.
* **Multiple Linear Regression**: Learned about multiple linear regression and the assumptions made by multiple linear regression.
* **Penalization Methods**: In this lesson, I learned about regularization as a method to make complex models simpler by penalizing coefficients to reduce their magnitude, and variance in the training set and in turn, reduce overfitting in the model.
* **Non-Linear Regression**: In this lesson, I learned about non-linear regression methods, model tuning and choosing parameters. Also, learnt the difference between parameters and hyperparameters.
* **GRADED QUIZ**:
